# Salary-Predicting-Project

### This repository is a representation if our Salary predictor model and the three files we are going to use to advance this project.

1- data_visualization.ipynb is responsible to visualize our datasets and see whatss relevant and what is not. <br />
2- cv_feature_extraction.ipynb is responsible for extracting the features from someone's CV. <br />
3- model_predictor.ipynb is the model itself that will be trained on our original Datasets and then it will be fed data from CV feature extractor which will make sure to only give the relevant data to the Model such as job type, age, etc....<br />
